# A Relational Database for Biblical Manuscripts

## Description

This is the home page of the relational biblical manuscripts database project, developed within the Artificial Intelligence for Cultural Heritage (AI4CH) center and the Data Science and Automatic Verification Laboratory at the University of Udine, Italy.
The database aims to pose itself as an integrated and generalizable framework to store, manage and leverage information about biblical manuscripts.

The current repository includes:
* an Excel file with the raw data about the biblical manuscripts: **TO-DO**
* the code to set up the database within a Postgres database instance: **TO-DO**
* the code to import the raw Excel file into the database: **TO-DO**
* the code of some queries that show how to use the database: **TO-DO**

The following picture reports the overall relational schema of the database:
